# Raspberry PI Battleship 2.2: Gianna and Akshar
This project is an in-progress attempt at debugging another group's beta version of Battleship 2.2. Alongside getting the code to work, we must not alter the layout of any significant functions but instead focus on refining what is already there to meet the Battleship 2.2 criteria (provided by the 402nd SWEG Internship). Our next steps past debugging will be to incorporate an LED matrix to display the battleship grid using a Raspberry PI.
